Submitted as part of the requirements for the GMIT Higher Diploma in Data Analysis as part of the module Programme for Data Analysis 2019

### Project Description: 
 - To create a dataset by simulating a real-world phenomenon of your choosing. The project requires you to model and synthesise data using Python. The project should include: 

 - A real-world phonemenon that can be measured and for which you could collect at least one-hundred daya points across at least for different variables

 - Investigate the types of variables involved, their likely distributions and their relationships with each other

- Synthesise/Simulate a data set as cloecly matching their properties as possible

 - Detail your research and implement the simulation in a Jupyter notebook - the data set itself can be simpley displayed in an output cell within the notebook.

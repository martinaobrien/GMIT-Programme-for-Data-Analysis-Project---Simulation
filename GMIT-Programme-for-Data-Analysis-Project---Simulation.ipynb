    "#### 1.1. Introduction and Background:\n",
    " \n",
    "Educational attainment is well known to be a factor influencing the employment predictability of an individual **(1)**. In Ireland, it is compulsory to attend full time education from the ages of 6 - 16 years or until the finish of 3 years of second level education or the completion of the Junior Cycle curriculum under the Education Act 2000 **(2)**. While Ireland is currently reaching full employment, with only 4.8% unemployment still existing (3). This rate is nearly equal to that of in 2007 before the economic recession occurred. This notebook explores data modelled on the predictability of an individual's employment status in relation to the highest level of education completed.<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "While the overall picture of employment looks healthy, there are still concerning statistics amongst certain groups of individuals in particular early school leavers (ESLs) **(4)**. Conversely, young people also experience high rates of unemployment in Ireland with 12.5% of young people. **(5, 6)**. Conversely, It is important to understand the relationship between education and employment in order to address the arising needs and promote resilience for individuals within recession as it is well know that those with higher education levels are more likely to be employed.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### About this dataset:  <br>\n",
    "In November, 2019, the most recent Educational Attainment Thematic Report 2019 was released by the Central Statistics Office, detailing the key findings in the relationship between educational attainment and employment **(7)**  This notebook will explore the relationship between educational attainment and employment in Ireland today.\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset will contain 200 data points over 4 variable: gender, age, educational attainment and employment.\n",
    "\n",
    "| Variable  | Type | Description |\n",
    "| --- | --- | --- |\n",
    "| Gender | Categorical | Sex - Male/Female |\n",
    "| Age | Numerical | Value between 25 and 65 years of ages|\n",
    "| Educational Attainment | Categorical | Highest level of education obtained|\n",
    "|Employment | Categorical | Employment status - Yes/No|\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "A dataset will be modelled on the findings of the above report insofar as possible and randomly synthesised for the purpose of this report. The weighted variables and methodology will be outlined in the next section. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Motivation for this project: \n",
    "As a youth work professional in the area of youth entrepreneurship, identifying barriers for accessing employment is a key aspect of the role. This project will enable me to gain some further insight into the current picture of unemployment in Ireland and the socio economic factors that may be associated with that.   "

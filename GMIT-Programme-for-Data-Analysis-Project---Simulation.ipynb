    "#### Introduction and Background to the Real-World Phenomenon: Educational Attainment and Employment\n",
    " \n",
    "Educational attainment is well known to be a factor influencing the employment predictability of an individual https://www.oecd-ilibrary.org/docserver/eag_highlights-2012-11-en.pdf?expires=1575233714&id=id&accname=guest&checksum=6E048A8FBA5F60213205266CDAA4CE07 http://www.welfare.ie/en/Pages/Chapter-3_-Risk-and-Protection-for-Children.aspx. In Ireland, it is compulsory to attend full time education from the ages of 6  - 16 years or until the finish of 3 years of second level education or the completion of the Junior Cycle curriculum under the Education Act 2000 https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/education/the_irish_education_system/overview_of_the_irish_education_system.html <br>\n",
    "\n",
    "While Ireland is currently reaching full employment, with only 4.8% unemployment existing.  https://www.cso.ie/en/statistics/labourmarket/monthlyunemployment/ , equal to that of in 2007 before the economic recession, http://www.welfare.ie/en/Pages/Chapter-3_-Risk-and-Protection-for-Children.aspx., unemployment and its link to educational attainment still needs to be explored. There are still considerable disparities with 12.3%  of young people currently unemployed https://tradingeconomics.com/ireland/youth-unemployment-rate. Early school leavers are particularly vulnerable to labour market isolation. http://publicpolicy.ie/papers/education-and-employment-a-review-of-educational-attainment-and-labour-market-outcomes/ <br>\n",
    "\n",
    "##### About this dataset:  <br>\n",
    "In November, 2019, the most recent Educational Attainment Thematic Report 2019 was released by the Central Statistics Office, detailing the key findings in the relationship between educational attainment and employment https://pdf.cso.ie/www/pdf/20191121085016_Educational_Attainment_Thematic_Report_2019_full.pdf. This notebook will explore the relationship between educational attainment and employment in Ireland today.\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset will contain 200 data points over 4 variable: gender, age, educational attainment and employment.\n",

    "A dataset will be modelled on the findings of the above report insofar as possible and randomly synthesised for the purpose of this report. The weighted variables and methodology will be outlined in the next section. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Motivation for this project: \n",
    "As a youth work professional in the area of youth entrepreneurship, identifying barriers for accessing education is a key aspect of the role. This project will enable me to gain some further insight into the current picture of unemployment in Ireland and the socio economic factors that may be associated with that.   "
